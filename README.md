# TrafficSimulation
Intelligent System Project

Our project simulates a simple traffic environment with roads, intersections, traffic lights, cars, and pedestrians. Here is the elaboration of the points concerning the agents, their reactions, interactions, and environmental factors:

## Agent-based modeling
Our project employs agent-based modeling to represent and simulate a traffic environment. The agents in our simulation include cars and pedestrians, both of which are derived from the Agent class.

## Reactions 
Agents in our project are designed to react to traffic lights and other agents. Cars react to traffic lights by stopping or moving, depending on the light's state. They also react to other cars ahead of them, slowing down or stopping to avoid collisions. Pedestrians react to traffic lights, stopping or moving based on the pedestrian light state. This illustrates the concepts of reactive agents and adaptive behavior.

## Interactions
The agents in our project interact with each other and with the environment. Cars interact with other cars by adjusting their speed and position to avoid collisions. Pedestrians interact with the environment by moving along the roads and crossing at intersections according to the pedestrian light state. These interactions demonstrate the principles of agent interactions and emergent properties.

## Environment factors
Our project models a simple traffic environment consisting of roads, intersections, and traffic lights. Roads have a specific length and lanes, while intersections have incoming and outgoing roads and traffic lights. Traffic lights control the flow of cars and pedestrians through the intersections. These factors contribute to the simulation and illustrate the importance of environmental factors in agent-based models.

In summary, the project demonstrates the principles of agent-based modeling, reactive agents, adaptive behavior, agent interactions, and environmental factors in the context of a simple traffic simulation. Cars and pedestrians react and adapt to the environment and other agents, and their interactions and behaviors emerge from the rules and conditions defined within the simulation.
